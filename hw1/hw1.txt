Looking at the average percent overlap and average Spearman Coefficient, DuckDuckGo seems to be performing much worse than Google. 
However, since DuckDuckGo focues on privacy a lot more than Google it is possible that the search results aren't influenced by demographic data.
A negative Spearman Coefficient also indicates that the two search engines use different algorithms for weighting and ranking the results in response to the queries.
